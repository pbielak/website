I am a graph machine learning specialist with a recently obtained PhD,
possessing over 4 years of industrial experience. My research expertise centers
on graph representation learning in terms of unsupervised and self-supervised
learning, yielding over 100 citations for my work. As an accomplished author of
both conference and journal articles, I've introduced several pioneering methods
in this field, such as GBT, AttrE2vec, and FILDNE. I am a dedicated Python
enthusiast and a well-rounded practitioner, proficient in full-stack machine
learning development, including DevOps/MLOps, as well as model implementation
and evaluation.
